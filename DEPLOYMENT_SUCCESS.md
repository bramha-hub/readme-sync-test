## 🧪 Test Your Deployment

After adding the API key secret, test that everything works:

### Option 1: Test on This Repository

```bash
# Make a small change
echo "# Test" >> test.md

# Commit and push
git add test.md
git commit -m "test: trigger README-Sync"
git push

# Check the Actions tab
# A workflow should run and create a PR
```

### Option 2: Use in Another Project

```powershell
# Navigate to another project
cd C:\path\to\your\project

# Deploy README-Sync to it
C:\Users\Lenovo\OneDrive\Desktop\Readme-sync\deploy-to-existing.ps1 -TargetRepo "."

# Add the API key secret to that repo too
# Make code changes and watch it work!
```
